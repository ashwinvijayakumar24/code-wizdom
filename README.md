# Code Wizdom Legacy Site

## https://code-wizdom.netlify.app/

This is a full-stack website I developed using React, Express, Node, MongoDB, and Tailwind for
my non-profit Code Wizdom, where I tutored 120+ kids in 3 countries by providing free online 1-on-1 programming courses in Python, Java, and JavaScript
